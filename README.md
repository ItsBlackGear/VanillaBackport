# VanillaBackport

What originally was Caves&CliffsBackport, has evolved to become a more universal mod, backporting more than a single version into a single mod rather than having various mods scattered around. ([Nether Backport](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extended-nether-backport), [Caves & Cliffs Backport](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-backport), and [The Wild Backport](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-wild-backport))

This allows to have better compatibility between backports without having to add dependencies between them and at the same time, give support to more versions.
